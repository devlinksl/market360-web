              <p>
                Market360 operates as a marketplace platform. When you purchase a Product through Market360, you are entering
                into a contract with the individual Seller of that Product — not with Market360. Market360 is not a party to
                any transaction between Buyers and Sellers and does not take title to any Product at any point. Market360's
                role is to facilitate the connection between Buyers and Sellers and to provide the infrastructure for secure
                payment processing.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.2 Buyer Obligations</h3>
              <p>As a Buyer, you agree to:</p>
              <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2 list-none">
                {[
                  "Read all Listing information carefully, including product descriptions, condition, pricing, delivery timelines, and return policies, before completing a purchase.",
                  "Pay for all Orders you place promptly and in full using a supported payment method. Initiating a payment and then abandoning an Order without cause is a violation of these Terms.",
                  "Provide accurate delivery information, including your correct name, address, and contact number, to ensure timely fulfillment.",
                  "Communicate respectfully and in good faith with Sellers and Market360 support staff at all times.",
                  "Confirm receipt of your Order within the timeframe specified by Market360 after delivery is marked complete. Failure to confirm receipt within 7 calendar days of confirmed delivery will result in automatic release of escrow funds to the Seller.",

              <p>
                An Order is considered confirmed and a legally binding contract is formed between Buyer and Seller at the point
                when Market360 sends you an order confirmation notification and payment is successfully processed. You will
                receive a transaction reference number and, where applicable, a payment receipt.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                Market360 reserves the right to cancel or void an Order at any time before delivery if (a) the Seller is
                unable to fulfil the Order, (b) the transaction is flagged by our fraud detection systems, (c) an error in
                pricing or product information is identified, or (d) we are required to do so by law or court order. In such
                cases, a full refund will be issued to the original payment method.

              <p>
                All eligible purchases on Market360 are covered by our Buyer Protection Policy. Under this policy, you may be
                entitled to a full or partial refund if: the Product does not arrive within the confirmed delivery window; the
                Product received materially differs from the Listing description; the Product is significantly damaged or
                defective on arrival; or the Seller fails to respond to a legitimate complaint within 48 hours of it being raised.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                Buyer Protection claims must be raised through the in-app dispute system within 7 calendar days of the confirmed
                delivery date. Claims raised after this period may not be eligible. Market360's determination on Buyer Protection
                claims is final, subject to any mandatory rights under applicable law.
              </p>

              <p>
                All prices on Market360 are displayed in Sierra Leonean Leones (Le) unless explicitly stated otherwise.
                Market360 does not offer currency conversion. The price displayed on a Listing at the time of purchase is

                To sell on Market360, you must complete the Seller registration process and pass our identity verification
                (KYC) procedure. KYC requires submission of a valid government-issued photo ID and, for business accounts,
                proof of business registration. Market360 may request additional documentation at any time. Sellers who have
                not completed KYC verification are restricted to a provisional listing limit and may not receive payouts.

              <p className="mt-3">
                Upon successful KYC completion, your Store will display a "Verified Seller" badge. This badge indicates that

                of any specific performance.

                A Store may be suspended separately from the Seller's personal Account in cases where Store-specific policy

              <p>
                The Market360 Wallet is an in-platform electronic money facility that allows registered users to hold, receive,
                send, and withdraw funds in Sierra Leonean Leones (Le). The Wallet is not a bank account and Market360 is not
                a bank or licensed deposit-taking institution. Funds held in your Wallet are not protected by the Sierra Leone
                Deposit Protection Fund or any equivalent scheme.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.2 Funding the Wallet</h3>
              <p>
                You may add funds to your Wallet using the following supported methods: Orange Money, Africell Money, and
                other mobile money operators as we make available from time to time. All deposits are processed in Sierra
                Leonean Leones. Market360 does not accept or hold foreign currency in Wallet accounts.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                Deposits are subject to minimum and maximum limits, which are published in the app and may be updated at any
                time. Market360 may decline any deposit transaction if it is flagged by our fraud prevention systems or if it
                would cause a regulatory limit to be exceeded.

              <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.3 Payments & Escrow</h3>
              <p>
                When a Buyer initiates a purchase, the transaction amount is deducted from the Buyer's Wallet (or collected
                via the chosen payment method) and held in escrow by Market360. Escrow funds are released to the Seller upon
                the earliest of: (a) the Buyer confirming receipt of the Order; (b) expiry of the 7-day confirmation window
                without a dispute being raised; or (c) resolution of any dispute in the Seller's favour.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                Market360 does not earn interest on escrow funds. Funds held in escrow are not accessible to Market360 for
                its own use and are held in a segregated account for the benefit of users.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sellers may withdraw their Wallet balance to a verified Orange Money or Africell Money account, or to a
                registered Sierra Leonean bank account. Withdrawals are subject to KYC verification, minimum withdrawal
                thresholds, and applicable processing fees as disclosed in the app at the time of withdrawal.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                Market360 processes withdrawal requests within 1–2 business days under standard conditions. Withdrawals may
                be delayed if additional verification is required, if a dispute affecting the relevant funds is pending, or
                if the withdrawal is flagged by our compliance or anti-money laundering controls.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.5 Wallet Security</h3>
              <p>
                You are responsible for the security of your Wallet. Market360 will never ask you to share your Wallet PIN
                or password. Any transaction initiated using your correct Account credentials will be treated as authorised
                by you. If you believe your Wallet has been compromised, contact us immediately at{" "}

                A Wallet that has not been accessed for a continuous period of 24 months will be classified as dormant.
                Market360 will notify you by email and in-app notification before a Wallet is classified as dormant. Dormant
                Wallets may be subject to a monthly maintenance fee. Funds in dormant Wallets are never forfeited to Market360

              <p>
                Market360 charges a Transaction Fee on each completed sale. The Transaction Fee is calculated as a percentage
                of the total Order value (excluding any separately stated delivery charge) and is deducted automatically from
                the Seller's payout before it is credited to the Wallet.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                The applicable Transaction Fee for your account will be displayed in your Seller Dashboard before you publish
                a Listing. Market360 reserves the right to modify its fee structure with 30 days' written notice. Changes to
                Transaction Fees will not apply retroactively to Orders placed before the effective date of the change.

                Transaction Fee charged on that Order will be reversed and credited back to the Seller's Wallet, less any
                applicable administrative charge. If a refund is the result of the Seller's own failure to fulfil the
                Order, the Transaction Fee will not be refunded.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.5 Disputed Payouts</h3>

                If you believe a Transaction Fee has been incorrectly calculated or a payout has not been correctly credited,
                you must raise the matter with Market360 within 60 days of the transaction date. Claims raised after this
                period may not be honoured. Market360 will investigate and respond to payout disputes within 10 business days.

              <p>
                In the event of any disagreement arising from a transaction, we strongly encourage Buyers and Sellers to
                attempt to resolve the matter directly and in good faith through in-app messaging before escalating to
                Market360. Many disputes can be resolved quickly through direct communication. Market360 will not accept
                a formal dispute submission unless the parties have genuinely attempted direct resolution, except in cases
                involving alleged fraud or serious misconduct.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.2 Raising a Formal Dispute</h3>
              <p>
                If direct resolution is not achieved within 48 hours of a dispute being raised with the Seller, either party
                may escalate the matter to Market360 through the in-app dispute system. The escalation must be made within
                7 calendar days of the confirmed delivery date or of the event giving rise to the dispute. Disputes submitted
                outside this window may not be eligible for Market360 intervention.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                When raising a formal dispute, you will be asked to provide: a description of the issue; the Order reference
                number; evidence supporting your position (photographs, screenshots, communications); and the resolution you
                are seeking.

              <p>
                Market360's Trust & Safety Team will review all submitted evidence impartially and without bias. The team
                will acknowledge receipt of a dispute within 24 hours and aims to issue a final determination within 7
                business days. Both parties will be given an opportunity to submit evidence and respond to the other party's
                submissions before a decision is made. Market360's determination is final, subject to any mandatory rights
                you may have under applicable consumer protection laws.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.4 Refund Processing</h3>
              <p>
                Where a refund is determined to be payable to a Buyer, the refund will be credited to the Buyer's Market360
                Wallet within 3–5 business days of the determination. Refunds are issued in Sierra Leonean Leones (Le).
                Market360 is not responsible for any losses resulting from currency exchange fluctuations between the time
                of purchase and the time of refund.

              <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.5 Chargebacks</h3>
              <p>
                If you initiate a chargeback through your mobile money provider or bank rather than using Market360's dispute
                system, your Account may be suspended pending investigation. Unjustified or fraudulent chargebacks are a
                violation of these Terms and may result in permanent Account termination and recovery of any amounts
                wrongfully charged back.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.6 Return Policy</h3>
              <p>
                Each Seller is responsible for setting and communicating their own return policy, which must be clearly stated
                in their Listing. Sellers may not enforce return policies that are more restrictive than Market360's minimum
                standards, which provide that Buyers may return a Product if: it does not match the Listing description; it
                arrives damaged or defective; or the wrong item is delivered. Market360's Buyer Protection Policy overrides
                any Seller return policy that is more restrictive than these minimum standards.
